# hw0

You will not be able to complete any assignments until I've added you to the Github organization for the class, which will give you access to the class repositories.

* Sign up for a Github account, if you do not have one already. If you do have one already, associate your nyu email address with that account [here](https://github.com/settings/emails).
* Email me your Github username to shepherd@cs.nyu.edu from your NYU email account with the subject OOP Github Account. The only thing in the body should be the username.
* You will get an email from Github with an invitation to join the nyu-oop organization. Follow the instructions to accept the invitation.
    
Once you have accepted in the invitation you will be able to see the other repositories here, including hw1.
